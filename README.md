# Weather Dashboard

## About

This app is a weather dashboard that allows you to see the current weather and a five day forecast. This app runs off of Jquery, Bootstrap, Day.js, and the Open Weather api. To view results, type in the name of a city and submit. If the search term is invalid, it should display an error message. Upon submission, the search term will be populated in the search history section. You are able to clear the search history with the clear history button.

#Required
